## Week1
I currently have a flask app that facilitates the following:
1. Registration
2. Login using session
3. Retrieval of student data from database
4. Exam - Only MCQ part (Hardcoding the evaluation)
5. View Result

There are Html templates supporting each routes in flask with bootstrap and css. Database is created using MySQL. The csvs were imported to the tables in the database. It contains 3 tables:
1. student_details : 150 students in total enrolled in the course
2. users : 125 students who have an account on the web application
3. scores : For storing the scores of the exam for the registered students

### Week 2 Plan
* Try to implement NLP for subjective questions
* Diversify question bank
* Choosing questions at random
* Try to implement a coding evaluation part of exam
